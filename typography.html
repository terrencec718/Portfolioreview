        <h1>Typography Overview</h1>
            <img src="Images/ColorTheory/typography-metal.png" width="600" alt="Painted Hands">
            <h1>What is typography—and why is it so vital?</h1>
            <p>Typography is the art and technique of arranging letters and text to make content legible, clear, and visually engaging. It encompasses font style, structure, and appearance, all meticulously designed to evoke emotions and convey specific messages. 
                In essence, typography transforms plain text into an expressive and impactful visual element.

                The origins of typography date back to the 11th century with the invention of movable type. Before the digital era, typography was a highly specialized craft, primarily associated with books, magazines, and public works. 
                A pivotal moment in typographic history came with the creation of the Gutenberg Bible, a masterpiece that revolutionized typography in the Western world.
                
                Fun fact: The typeface used in the Gutenberg Bible, known as Textura, remains influential to this day. You can even find it as a font option in many major desktop applications—a testament to its timeless legacy.
                
                Typography continues to evolve, yet its core purpose remains the same: to bring words to life in a way that resonates with readers. <a href="fontTypesArticle.html"><em>Articles</em></a></p>

                <h2>Difference between Fonts and typefaces:</h2>
<p>The terms ‘fonts’ and ‘typefaces’ are often used interchangeably, although there are subtle differences between the two. Put simply, typeface refers to an entire family of fonts, which can be different weights. 
However, fonts refer to the individual weights, styles and widths that make up each typeface family when applied to lowercase letters, capital letters and numerals.</p>
    
    <h2>10 Key Typography Terms</h2>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <ol start="1">
                        <li><p><strong>Type</strong> — the individual characters or symbols used for creating written communication.
                            It can be physical, such as metal or wood blocks with raised letterforms, or digital, as in the form of computer-generated characters.</p></li>
                            <li><p><strong>Typeface</strong> — a specific family or design of letterforms that share consistent visual characteristics, including the shape, style, weight, and overall appearance of the characters. 
                                Typefaces encompass different variations within a family, such as regular, bold, italic, and different widths.</p></li>
                                <li><p><strong>Font</strong> — a specific set of letterforms, numbers, symbols, and other characters in a particular style, size, and weight. 
                                    A font file is the digital representation of a typeface and includes various variations (e.g., bold, italic) within the typeface family.</p></li>
                                    <li><p><strong>Serif</strong> — An extra stroke that is added to the end of the main vertical and horizontal strokes of a letterform. 
                                        Serif typeface when used in print form is "argued" to be the most legible choice. Two common serif choices are Times New Roman and Georgia. Impressions conveyed by Serif are traditional, professional, and established.</p></li>
                                        <li><p><strong>Sans-Serif</strong> — When serifs are absent from a typeface. Sans give the impression of strong, contemporary, clean, and simplified. Common sans serif are Arial and Helvetica.</p></li>
                    </ol>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <ol start="6">
                    <li><p><strong>Hierarchy</strong> — Establishing a hierarchy is one of the most vital principles of typography.
                        Typographical hierarchy aims to distinguish between prominent pieces of copy that should be noticed and read first and standard text copy.
                         </p></li>
                         <li><p><strong>White space</strong> — Often referred to as “negative space,” white space is the space around text or graphics.
                            White space can draw attention to the text and provide an aesthetically pleasing experience. White space often takes the form of margins, padding, or just areas with no text or graphics.</p></li>
                            <li><p><strong>Character</strong> — An individual symbol of the full character set that makes up a typeface; may take the form of a letter, number, punctuation mark, etc.</p></li>
                            <li><p><strong>Leading</strong> — The vertical space between baselines. The term originates from early days of printing, when lead was used to increase the vertical spacing between lines of type.</p></li>
                            <li><p><strong>Kerning</strong> — The spacing in between characters.</p></li>
                </ol></td>
