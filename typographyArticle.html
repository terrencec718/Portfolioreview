                <h3>Exploring Effective Color Design: A Personal Takeaway</h3>
                <p>During my research on what defines good or bad typography in a layout, I explored several websites showcasing diverse approaches.

                    The interplay of these elements created designs that not only complemented the overall aesthetic but also deeply engaged the viewer.
